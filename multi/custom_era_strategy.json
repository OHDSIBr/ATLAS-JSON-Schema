A drug era will be derived from all drug exposure events for any of the drugs within the concept set, using the specified persistence window as a maximum allowable gap in days between successive exposure events and adding a specified surveillance window to the final exposure event. If no exposure event end date is provided, then an exposure event end date is inferred to be event start date + days supply in cases when days supply is available or event start date + 1 day otherwise. This event persistence assures that the cohort end date will be no greater than the drug era end date.",
